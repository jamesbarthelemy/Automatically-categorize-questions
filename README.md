# Automatically categorize questions

Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A site related to IT development.

To ask a question on this site, you must enter several tags in order to easily find the question later. For experienced users, this is not a problem, but for new users, it would be a good idea to suggest some tags related to the question asked.

A fan of Stack Overflow, which has often saved your life, you decide to help the community in return. For this, you develop a tag suggestion system for the site. This will take the form of a machine learning algorithm that will automatically assign several relevant tags to a question.
