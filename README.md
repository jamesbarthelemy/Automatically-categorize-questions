# Automatically categorize questions

Stack Overflow is a website offering questions and answers on a wide range of computer programming topics. A member wishing to ask a question must use the dedicated form in which he must fill in a title, a question and 1 to 5 tags in order to categorize it. For experienced users this is not a problem, but for new users it would be a good idea to suggest some tags related to the question asked.

The proposed solution consists of setting up a tag suggestion tool. It will be based on the title and content of the question. After a first pre-processing, a machine learning model will propose a series of tags depending on the content of the question asked.
